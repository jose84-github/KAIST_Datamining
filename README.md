### Final Project : PEP Prediction Project

### 1. Introduction

**▷ Objective**  
```
To predict whether a pension insurance product is subscribed or not by utilizing customer data.
```
---
**▷ Data**  
```
- 12 variables, 600 records
```
---
**▷ Requirements**
```
- X variables: 10 variables excluding ID and PEP + additional generating variables
- Y variable: PEP
- Train / Test ratio: 70% / 30%
- 3 or more predictive models to implement
- Perform preprocessing on X variables
- Create at least 5 additional variables
```
---
**▷ Modeling**
```  
• Optimize parameters used in the modeling process by Grid Search  
• Selecting various modeling techniques and algorithms that can accurately predict PEP values  
• Chosen 10 trial Model (*Top 3 model)
